Approach to the task assigned
-----------------------------

1. I have created an interface that contains 4 operations
a. CreateSubscription
b. ReadSubscription
c. UpdateSubscription
d. PostMessage

CreateSubscription contains  MessageType, which can be a XML message or other format.
It will be subscribing essentially on some topic that can be "java topic", "SOA topic", "ESB topic", "Microservices topic" etc..


There are two implementation  that I have depicted too.

    1. RestFul Call, that can be called from thin (servlets or server side components) or thick clients (node.js,  angular.js, etc, applets)
    2. Soap Call, Application can also call SOAP call request with messageType as XML and other, that can be implemented.
    
    There can be other solutions as well. 
    JMX and others communication channels can communicate for this operations that can be implemented, for example JMX implementation can also be   
      incorporated where the TCP protocol is listening.
    JMS based communication can also be implemented.

Each operation has a handler attached to it that essentially that can be delegated to either threads, or JMS queue/topic or tasks(other web service calls)  that can be created.


There can have multiple handlers for events ( like createSubscription and updateSubscriptipon, etc...) that can be started or boot at the start, or it can be upgraded as per the requirement

These handler keeps track of the events, with all the threads.

The information can be persisted to the storage ( database, NOSQL, or other ) as required by these handlers.

Property file can be added, to configure startup handler like 2 handlers for createSubscription, 1 for updateSubscription etc..., start.
